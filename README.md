## C- Compiler

Compiler for the "C-" programming language built originally for my CS445-Compilers course in 2022 at the University of Idaho.

___
"C-" is the name given to the version of C used in the projects, simplified for time constraints. Details can be found in the project documentation.

While most of the testing performed on the many compartmentalized functions of the compiler succeeded (ex: parsing, AST construction, various symbol table functionalities, etc), the final goal of code emission for the virtual TM was never achieved. 

As much of this code was hastily written due to its time constraints of being written in a classroom setting, and as much was learned since starting this project, rather than trying to make this codebase work, it was decided to restart the project entirely.
